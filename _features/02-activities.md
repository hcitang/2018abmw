**Program: TBA**

We will take some time to present our work with one another, where the bulk of the workshop is focused on discussion about new work and opportunities.

Planned activities: mini-[pechakucha](https://www.pechakucha.org/) sharing, speed dating discussions, and brainstorming/design sessions.

NSERC, MITACS and the Faculty of Science will provide presentations about federal funding opportunities.
